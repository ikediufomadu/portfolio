                Looking to improve my skills with databases and learn new languages lead me to creating the project Query Augur. Query Augur is a person-finding database that can be accessed by the public and public service workers. With the ability to search individuals up by a multitude of different parameters Query Augur aims to provide critical information about people to people. End users will be able to search for anybody they want.

                When I took software engineering COSC412 we were tasked to come up with a software that could either serve a humanitarian need or a business need. The end result of countless days brainstorming with my team was REMEDI. REMEDI is an application that stores all the user's medical prescriptions and ailments.
